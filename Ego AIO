And today we are going to be talking about the EGO AIO by Joyetech.

(Hold up device to camera)

This little guy is an all-in-one device, with a 2ml tank capacity, leak proof design and a childproof lid.

To power the device you will need to press the fire button 5 times within a second, the flashing tank light 
- will let you know if it has been done correctly.

To change the color of the led below the tank power the device off, then hold the fire button for 5 seconds
- or until the tank lights up. Then choose the color that you woild like by pressing the fire button. When 
- you reach your desired color release the power button and wait for the led to turn off, power on your device 
- with the standard 5 clicks and enjoy your new tank color.

With a built-in 1500 milliamp hour battery the EGO AIO will provide you with at least 6 hours of battery life.
Battery Life depends on how uch you use the device, but if it is dying and you really need your fix, you can
charge the device and vape on it at the same time.

The starter kit comes with two point 6 ohm coils, a charge cable, an extra drip tip, and of course the device.

Lets get a closer look at the AIO, so I can walk you through how to set it up and preform general maintenance.

<Camera Close up on device>

So when you first open your new device, you will see the mod and a white box within the packaging. You will need
- to remove the mod from the plastic sleeve and take a coil out of the white box. Notice that the charging port 
- is located on the side of the device.

<Camera Close Up on Coil>

To prep the device for use you will first need to prime your coil. This is to ensure that you don't burn the coil
- out on your first puff. To do this remove the coil from the blister pack and open your liquid. Now put 6 to 8 drops
- of liquid directly in the center of the coil. This is to make sure that the cotton within the coil is well saturated 
- with liquid. 

Now we can start assembling the device. Attach the coil to the top cap it's super easy and it just threads on there
- now we can fill the device all the way up the the max fill like located on the side of the device, it might be hard
- to see but its there. IF you over-fill the device it will push liquid out where the top cap meets the device. After you 
- get the tank filled up, go ahead and drop the top cap into the tank. Press down on the childproof ring and begin to tighten
- the top cap onto the device.

Now take about 5 puffs from the device without pressing any buttons, this is another step to ensure that your first puff doesn't
- burn the coil out. 

All we have to do now is power the device on and you can begin vaping! Coils will last between 7 and 21 days depending on usage,
- liquid consistancy and color. So if you find that your coil is burning out fast try swapping flavors to something less sweet 
- and lighter in color.

Preforming maintenance on the EGO AIO is really easy. 
First we are going to cover changing a coil. You'll know when its time to change coils when the taste of your liquid is starting
- to change or if the liquid tastes burnt.

So replacing a burnt coil is really simple, all you have to do is remomve the top cap. Unscrew the old coil, prime a new coil and 
- thread it back on to the top cap, give it a couple of dry pulls without pressing the button and you are back in business. Wasn't 
- that easy?

Swapping flavors is just as easy as replacing a coil. So lets say you are switching to a Strawberry flavored liquid from a Coffee liquid.
If you just put the strawberry liquid into your device and leave the coffee coil in there you are going to taste the coffee until you 
- swap coils and rinse your tank out.

<Camera Close up on hands>

I recommend using a needle bottle filled with hot water to rinse the tank out. The reason why is because the needle bottle is easy to 
- control and minimizes the risk of damaging the internal circuit.

So to start lets open the device and remove the old coil. 
Next use the needle bottle to clean out the tank section of the device.
Now use a paper towel or kitchen rag to dry the tank completely.
We can now attach a new primed coil to the top cap and fill the device with the new liquid.

Make sure to do about 5 dry puffs without pressing the button, and then you are good to go.
